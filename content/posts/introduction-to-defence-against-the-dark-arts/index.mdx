Defensive magic is important as it allows one to protect themselves and their homes from Dark Arts and other possible threats. Witches and wizards have to deal with those who engage in Dark Arts on a daily basis and defensive magic provides a way of avoiding damage whilst not causing permanent harm to the opponent. In a society in which spells that are considered of dark nature are frowned upon, defensive magic gives us the option to choose how to fight and therefore we are not forced to use spells that we condemn or find morally wrong. For example, against an opponent who uses the Killing Curse, we can use equally useful but harmless defensive spells such as the Stunning Spell. This spell would knock the opponent unconscious, making them unable to duel. The Killing Curse aims to take the opponent out as well, however as a result causes irreversible damage. Stunning, on the other hand, can be counteracted and does not cause any permanent damage to the opponent.
